## HashMap

A `HashMap` is a map that uses a hash table to store its key-value pairs. It is not ordered and does not guarantee the order of its elements. It is also not synchronized and is not thread-safe. If multiple threads access a hash map concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the map structurally, it must be synchronized externally.
